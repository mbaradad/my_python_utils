# Install  
To install the requirements and opencv, just do:

```
pip install -r requirements
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

For extra requirements (that are more strange and may be hard to find in some systems, like company clusters) install requirements_extra.txt. 
Without it some of the functionalities may fail, though they are rarely used in my projects:

`pip install -r requirements_extra.txt`
